# BSOD-Counter
This program will keep track of how many BSODS you've had

This program was made for the sole purpose of keeping track of how many BSODS you have had
This was made initially as a joke but it turned out to be a good way of tracking how many issues you have had
It was also made to remind myself of just hom many times ive messed up my code that bad to cause such a thing 

I may build apon this programm maybe adding more info such to why you bluescreened and maybe some more features.
Yet this is pointless since WinDBG is a thing and that is used for that sole purpose among other things
