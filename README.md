# BSOD-Counter
This program was made for the sole purpose of keeping track of how many BSODS you have had.

This was made initially as a joke but it turned out to be a good way of tracking how many issues you have had.
It was also made to remind myself of just hom many times ive messed up my code that bad to cause such a thing.

I may build apon this programm maybe adding more info such to as why you bluescreened and maybe some more features.
Yet this is pointless since WinDBG is a thing and that is used for that sole purpose among other things.

instructions:
1, compile
2, place compiled executable inside of your startup programs
to get to your startup programs you press Windows Key + R
then in the run box you put : shell:startup
press enter and drag either a shortcut or the program itself into this folder


everytime your windows boots up this program will  check to see if on this boot, you had a bsod.

I could make this programm run on system boot but i think that would be overkill.
